I have started doing heavy-duty research into wxPerl, and have created a bit of skeleton code for subclasses, as well as cpan-ready file layout. I am starting on the documentation of the classes I am using (mainly subclasses of wxTreeCtrl to display the data).  At this rate, my documentation will be mostly finished before I even have one line of handwritten code!
