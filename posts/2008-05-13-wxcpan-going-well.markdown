I have successfully managed to implement a CPANPLUS::Shell.  You call the shell like:
<code>perl -MCPANPLUS -e 'shell(Wx)'</code>

I have created a perl script for testing this.

I have also created a new svn branch, <code>development</code>. This is the current working branch.

You can view or download my current development code, via svn. See the googlcode svn: http://code.google.com/p/wxcpan/source/browse
