		<div class="description hidden">Ideas on how to teach CSC courses using only a web browser</div>
		<p>With the web becoming more pervasive and HTML5 threatening to annihilate Flash,
is JavaScript becoming a viable language for teaching advanced topics in
computer science? Here is a run-down of topics and projects that could be used
to teach the courses. The following course listing is taken from my university,
the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I have organized them by course
content, as some courses use similar tools/methods. Also note that some courses
are designed to teach specific software, outside of the browser, so I have
placed them under the topic “Outside the Browser”</p>
<h2 id="general-programming-courses">General Programming Courses</h2>
<h2 id="graphics">Graphics</h2>
<h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>
<h3 id="230-elementary-data-structures-and-algorithms">230 Elementary Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
<p>Advanced syntax of high level language taught in CSC 130. Emphasis on
modularization and abstraction. Big-O analysis of algorithms. Design and use of
abstract data types with various implementations.</p>
<h2 id="networking">Networking</h2>
<h2 id="math-based-courses">Math-Based Courses</h2>
<h3 id="250-foundations-of-computer-science-i">250 Foundations of Computer Science I</h3>
<p>An introduction to the fundamental ideas underlying contemporary computer
science with a focus on the computation and construction of objects.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>These classes are designed to teach specific hardware concepts</p>
<h3 id="261-computer-organization-and-assembly-language">261 Computer Organization and Assembly Language</h3>
<p>CPU, memory, I/O devices, digital logic design, psw. Number representations
and machine language. Assembly language instruction types, registers,
addressing, arithmetic, instruction format, opcodes, pseudo-opcodes, assembler
directives, system calls, and macros.</p>
<p>Many would think this class would be difficult to do in the browser, but there
are many assembly interpreters written in JavaScript.  Here are a few online
interpreters of interest for this classJS:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://http://timhatch.com/projects/jsassembly/" rel="nofollow">JSAssembly</a> - an interpeter for x86 assembly codes</li>
<li><a href="http://benfirshman.com/projects/jsnes/" rel="nofollow">JSNES</a> - Great working interpreter for SNES ROM images</li>
<li><a href="http://6502asm.com/" rel="nofollow">6502asm</a> - 6502 assembly code interpreter</li></ul>
<p>I did not find any online SPARC interpreters, as UNCG teaches this course in
SPARC assembly, but it would be trivial to modify one of the above to suit. </p>
