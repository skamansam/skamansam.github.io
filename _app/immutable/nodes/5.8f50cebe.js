My name is Samuel C Tyler and I love to code. I have been a full-stack developer and avid open sourcerer since 1999.

I started building web sites in 1996, at the age of 17. I taught myself HTML, Javascript, and Perl to begin with. Then learned REALbasic, and dabbled in Pascal and Fortran enough to do some basic stuff on my Mac. In 1999 I started using Red Hat Linux and by 2002 I was Linux only. By this time I had enough knowledge to start building full-stack web applications, so I started focusing more on those technologies, primarily the LAMP stack. By 2005 I had learned enough to be able to teach myself whatever I wanted, but lacked direction so I decided to go to uni to find it. While there I worked as the only Web Developer for the largest college on campus. I won several assistantships and landed a job right out of uni, using Ruby on Rails.
