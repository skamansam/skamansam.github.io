my home server (case of mistaken identity), so I needed to build a new one. This
was more fortuitous than not, as it gave me the opportunity to build a system
which I could use for another decade. I always insist on older hardware, with
the most options for upgrade. So I bought a pretty sweet setup that I can
upgrade a little at a time until socket LGA1155 goes out of style. As of now,
that means a quad-core i7 will run on my machine - not too bad for the next
decade!

create a dual-boot system with Fedora 16 and Windows 7. I wanted to use my new
graphics goodness for CUDA application design and, of course, games. I installed
Windows 7, then Fedora 16 for a normal dual-boot configuration. Then came the
hard part: how to make Fedora switch video drivers based on whther it boots in
VirtualBox or not.`,h,l,b=`<h3 id="update">Update:</h3> <p>This article was never really finished. Basically, I used an init script to detect the presence of the virtualbox virtual instructionset,

the drivers, and the system will take care of the rest.</p>`;return{c(){e=p("p"),e.textContent=r,i=_(),n=p("ul"),n.innerHTML=t,o=_(),s=p("p"),s.textContent=v,h=_(),l=p("blockquote"),l.innerHTML=b},l(a){e=w(a,"P",{["data-svelte-h"]:!0}),f(e)!=="svelte-mnyd5c"&&(e.textContent=r),i=y(a),n=w(a,"UL",{["data-svelte-h"]:!0}),f(n)!=="svelte-wj9auc"&&(n.innerHTML=t),o=y(a),s=w(a,"P",{["data-svelte-h"]:!0}),f(s)!=="svelte-jdorni"&&(s.textContent=v),h=y(a),l=w(a,"BLOCKQUOTE",{["data-svelte-h"]:!0}),f(l)!=="svelte-l531ps"&&(l.innerHTML=b)},m(a,d){u(a,e,d),u(a,i,d),u(a,n,d),u(a,o,d),u(a,s,d),u(a,h,d),u(a,l,d)},p:P,d(a){a&&(m(e),m(i),m(n),m(o),m(s),m(h),m(l))}}}function E(c){let e,r;const i=[c[0],C];let n={$$slots:{default:[$]},$$scope:{ctx:c}};for(let t=0;t<i.length;t+=1)n=g(n,i[t]);return e=new N({props:n}),{c(){D(e.$$.fragment)},l(t){S(e.$$.fragment,t)},m(t,o){G(e,t,o),r=!0},p(t,[o]){const s=o&1?L(i,[o&1&&x(t[0]),o&0&&x(C)]):{};o&2&&(s.$$scope={dirty:o,ctx:t}),e.$set(s)},i(t){r||(A(e.$$.fragment,t),r=!0)},o(t){M(e.$$.fragment,t),r=!1},d(t){H(e,t)}}}const C={comments:!0,view:"post",layout:"post",lang:"en",author:"skamansam",title:"How to Keep Your Linux Always-On In A Dual-Boot System",description:"Keeping nVidia loaded across boots",excerpt:"Then came the hard part - how to make Fedora switch video drivers based on whther it boots in VirtualBox or not.",cover:!1,coverImage:!1,coverAlt:"RBE Logo",categories:["linux"],tags:["Dual Boot","nVidia","CUDA"],created_at:"2012-02-04T08:10:00.000Z",updated_at:"2020-09-01T01:29:00.000Z",preview:`During my move from Greensboro, NC to Baltimore, MD, I accidentally threw away
