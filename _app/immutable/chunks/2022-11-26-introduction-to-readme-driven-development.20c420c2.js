wondered why your undocumented project is getting nowhere, despite having an initial boost of momentum
that soon died down? Ever wondered how to get your app from idea to implementation quickly and efficiently?

Everyone in software development is familiar with the README. It is the first thing anyone sees when visiting a code repository&#39;s main page. It has a vast history in software and can be traced back to at least 1975, included as <a href="http://pdp-10.trailing-edge.com/decuslib10-04/index.html" title="">a file in decuslib for the PDP-10</a>. README-Driven development leverages the familiarity of the README to help developers organize their ideas and help propel them into the development process.',z,M,ee="The idea is a fairly simple one - progress on the README shows progress in the app development cycle. As you complete the README, you get closer and closer to a 1.0 version release.
