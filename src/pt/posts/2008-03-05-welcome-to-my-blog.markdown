Hello, all! This is the blog for "Skaman Sam" Tyler, founder of Rude Boy Enterprises. I love to code and fix problems. This blog is all about my code and solutions to problems relating to Linux, Windows (probably not much there), and other computer-related issues. I hope this will be as educational for you as for me!
