Hello, all RBS followers! I am creating a new theme for WordPress called Bubbly Blue, which is part of my Bubbly Blue theme series. So far I have only one other - an Ampache theme. I am using this blog as a testing area for this theme, so please be patient if something goes horribly awry!

Thank you all!
<h3>Updated August 9:</h3>
Here are some features of my theme so far:
<ul>
	<li>Three-Layer Header for more customization! = The background layer is for gradients, etc. The Logo layer is for your logo. The FX layer is for added graphics to enhance the other layers.</li>
	<li>A top menu, which can show all pages as tabs. Also doubles as a sidebar.</li>
	<li>Three sidebars: one dropdown menu and two sidebars on either side of main content area. These can be turned on/off in the options panel.</li>
	<li>W3C standards-compliance. A graphic link has been added to the footer so you can just click to test
the validity of each page.</li>
</ul>
My theme is almost complete! Still left to do:
<ul>
	<li>Move header text over when logo is enabled/disabled</li>
	<li>Fix Comments/Respond tabs on posts</li>
	<li>Create Default sidebar widgets if dynamic widgets are not available</li>
	<li>Add login form to header/sidebar and add option for which to use.</li>
	<li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Resize content area when sidebars are turned off.</li>
	<li style="text-decoration: line-through;">Curve corners of header, footer and sidebars</li>
	<li>Sort Through and optimize Stylesheet</li>
	<li>Ajax-ify Comments</li>
	<li>Three-Layer header options panel.</li>
	<li>Remove unused php files / consolidate php files</li>
	<li>Cleanup code!</li>
	<li>More Testing!</li>
</ul>
