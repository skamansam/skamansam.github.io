### Rude Boy Solutions has Moved To Octopress!

Rude Boy Solutions is now moving to Octopress for blogging! Wordpress was great fun while it lasted, but I rarely use it anymore, as I am creating my own blogging platform, pSaMS (padrino Sams Management System), so this is an intermediate step. Also, the first item before pSaMS is production-ready, is the ability to import and export posts from/to github. I chose markdown as that format, so I am trying to create a plugin for pSaMS for Octopress import/export.
