I am so excited! After a few month's anticipation, I got accepted into Google's Summer of Code! My project is a 
GUI for CPAN. You can [read more about it here](http://code.google.com/soc/2008/perl/appinfo.html?csaid=CF55D713AEE494A4).
Look for more of my summer of code adventures here, under the gSoC tag!
