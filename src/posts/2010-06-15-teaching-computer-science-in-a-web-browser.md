With the web becoming more pervasive and HTML5 threatening to annihilate Flash, is JavaScript becoming a viable language for teaching advanced topics in computer science? Here is a run-down of topics and projects that could be used to teach the courses. The following course listing is taken from my university, the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I have organized them by course content, as some courses use similar tools/methods. Also note that some courses are designed to teach specific software, outside of the browser, so I have placed them under the topic "Outside the Browser"
<h2>General Programming Courses</h2>
<h2><strong>Graphics</strong></h2>
<h2>Algorithms</h2>
<strong>230 Elementary Data Structures and Algorithm</strong>s
Advanced syntax of high level language taught in CSC 130. Emphasis on modularization and abstraction. Big-O analysis of algorithms. Design and use of abstract data types with various implementations.
<h2>Networking</h2>
<h2>Math-Based Courses</h2>
<strong>250 Foundations of Computer Science I
</strong>An introduction to the fundamental ideas underlying contemporary computer science with a focus on the computation and construction of objects.
<h2>Hardware
<span style="font-weight: normal; font-size: 13px;">These classes are designed to teach specific hardware concepts</span></h2>
<strong>261 Computer Organization and Assembly Language
</strong><em>CPU, memory, I/O devices, digital logic design, psw. Number representations and machine language. Assembly language instruction types, registers, addressing, arithmetic, instruction format, opcodes, pseudo-opcodes, assembler directives, system calls, and macros.</em>

<em><span style="font-style: normal;">Many would think this class would be difficult to do in the browser, but there are many assembly interpreters written in JavaScript. Â Here are a few online interpreters of interest for this classJS:</span></em>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://http://timhatch.com/projects/jsassembly/">JSAssembly </a>- an interpeter for x86 assembly codes</li>
	<li><a href="http://benfirshman.com/projects/jsnes/">JSNES</a> - Great working interpreter for SNES ROM images</li>
	<li><a href="http://6502asm.com/">6502asm</a> - 6502 assembly code interpreter</li>
</ul>
I did not find any online SPARC interpreters, as UNCG teaches this course in SPARC assembly, but it would be trivial to modify one of the above to suit. As for the Hardware design portion of this course, it is taught from a G/8llllllllllllllltextbook on SPARC assembly.
<h2>Outside the Browser</h2>
These courses are designed to teach specific software, and
