# ‚úÖ Lists

## ‚úÖ Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:
    * Ac tristique libero volutpat at
    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

## ‚úÖ Emoji Support

Github-style emojis are supported via [node-emoji](https://github.com/omnidan/node-emoji). [List of emojis](https://www.webfx.com/tools/emoji-cheat-sheet/).
Emoticons are supported via [emoticons](https://github.com/wooorm/emoticon/blob/HEAD/support.md).

## ‚úÖ Latex Support
You can write html, that contains expressions like this:  $x ^ 2 + 5$ inside them. As you probably know. You also can write expressions in display mode as follows: 
$$ 
\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i^2 - \overline{x}^2)
$$
In first case you will need to use \$expression\$ and in the second one \$\$expression\$\$. To escape the \$ symbol it's mandatory to write as follows: \\$. To use `display` mode, the block 
MUST begin with \$\$ and end with \$\$.

</TagCloud>
