Hello, all RBS followers! I am creating a new theme for WordPress called Bubbly
Blue, which is part of my Bubbly Blue theme series. So far I have only one other
- an Ampache theme. I am using this blog as a testing area for this theme, so
please be patient if something goes horribly awry!

Thank you all!

### Updated August 9:
Here are some features of my theme so far:
* Three-Layer Header for more customization! = The background layer is for
  gradients, etc. The Logo layer is for your logo. The FX layer is for added
  graphics to enhance the other layers.
* A top menu, which can show all pages as tabs. Also doubles as a sidebar.
* Three sidebars: one dropdown menu and two sidebars on either side of main
  content area. These can be turned on/off in the options panel.
* W3C standards-compliance. A graphic link has been added to the footer so you
  can just click to test the validity of each page.

My theme is almost complete! Still left to do:
* Move header text over when logo is enabled/disabled
* Fix Comments/Respond tabs on posts
* Create Default sidebar widgets if dynamic widgets are not available
* Add login form to header/sidebar and add option for which to use.
    * ~~Resize content area when sidebars are turned off.~~
    * ~~Curve corners of header, footer and sidebars~~
* Sort Through and optimize Stylesheet
* Ajax-ify Comments
* Three-Layer header options panel.
* Remove unused php files / consolidate php files
* Cleanup code!
* More Testing!
