It is now day 0 for gSoC - the first day. I have hit the ground running and am off to a good 
start. I have already created the CPANPLUS::Shell integration and the file layout necessary 
for uploading to CPAN.

Today, I plan on running some tests to gather output from CPANPLUS and posting notes on [my 
project's wiki](http://wxcpanplus.googlecode.com). I plan on testing searching, listing 
installed modules, listing updated modules and parsing all this output into some form I 
can really use.

Come back later for more, as I plan on keeping updating this blog at every landmark 
accomplishment of this project.
