Aptana is a wonderful tool for web design. I have been using it for years for my
personal web sites and my professional ones. I have been trying to get more
people turned on to it, as well. When I installed Fedora 10 recently, I didn't
want to install Aptana, as it has, in the past, FooBar'd my Eclipse
installation. However, I am learning Ruby (on rails), and want to install
RadRails, which means I need Aptana. I thought about installing Aptana
standalone, but don't want to start up a new Eclipse platform just for my rails
development. So -

First, I tried to install Aptana normally, as an eclipse plugin, several times.
However, some parts of it refused to work and the "My Aptana" page never showed
up. After assessing this problem, I thought there may be conflicts with some of
the plugins Fedora installs through yum. IhadÂ  installed all the Eclipse plugins
that my yum repositories offered.

So I removed all the plugins using yum. Since I needed those plugins, I had to
get the update sites to install in Eclipse. Here are the update sites for the
rpms, for convenience. You can get the same information by checking the Fedora
Eclipse project wiki at http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Eclipse.
