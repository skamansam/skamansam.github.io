I have started doing heavy-duty research into wxPerl, and have created a bit of 
skeleton code for subclasses, as well as cpan-ready file layout. I am starting 
on the documentation of the classes I am using (mainly subclasses of wxTreeCtrl 
to display the data).  At this rate, my documentation will be mostly finished 
before I even have one line of handwritten code!
