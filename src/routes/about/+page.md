# About Me

## The Elevator Pitch
Good day! My name is Samuel C Tyler and I love to code. I have been a full-stack developer and avid open sourcerer since 1999. I have been working professionally since 2007 creating web applications and managing web sites for a wide variety of clientelle, from Universities to Medical Software to Inventory Management and everything in between. I am currently working with Vue, Python, Django, PostgreSQL, and Kubernetes. I am working on realizing my dream of a list management application, through which I am mentoring. I have many open source applications and ideas on GitHub and am interested in learning more about Svelte and UX design.

## Dev History
My name is Samuel C Tyler, aka Skaman Sam, and I have been an avid open source developer since 1999. I started building web sites in 1996, at the age of 17. I taught myself HTML, Javascript, and Perl to begin with. Then learned REALbasic, and dabbled in Pascal and Fortran enough to do some basic stuff on my Mac. In 1999 I started using Red Hat Linux and by 2002 I was Linux only. By this time I had enough knowledge to start building full-stack web applications, so I started focusing more on those technologies, primarily the LAMP stack. By 2005 I had learned enough to be able to teach myself whatever I wanted, but lacked direction so I decided to go to uni to find it. While there I worked as the only Web Developer for the largest college on campus. I won several assistantships and landed a job right out of uni, using Ruby on Rails. I have continued to use many different tools in my professional career, and still teach myself fun things in my spare time. 

**Here's some stuff I use**

- SvelteKit
