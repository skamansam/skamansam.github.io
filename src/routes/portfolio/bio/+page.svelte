	I started building web sites in 1996 and quickly moved to web applications in Perl::CGI on Linux
	servers. I went on to build several desktop apps &nbsp;in Perl::Gtk, Perl::Tk, and
	Perl::WxWidgets, mostly for systems management. I built my first blog in 1999, called MeHome (now
	PSaMs) and have been working with dynamic web sites ever since. I was awarded a chance to work
	with Google during the Summer of Code 2008, where I developed a frontend to Perl::CPANPLUS, called <a
		href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/wxcpan/">WxCPAN</a
	>.&nbsp;

	After graduating college, I landed a job with MDLogix, working with Ruby on Rails with
	&nbsp;custom frontends. As project lead there, I oversaw the design and development of many web
	applications used throught the healthcare industry, including mobile surveys for psychological
	diagnosis in children, the elderly, and soldiers on the battlefield. I also developed a social
	network analysis and visualization application, Socioworks, used in crisis management. I also
	helped develop the initial version of BHWorks, the company's current flagship product.&nbsp;

<p>
	After working in the healthcare industry for nearly 5 years, I joined the private sector and
	worked with the reverse-logistics company, Optoro, initially working on the company-facing
	software used by company managament and accounting. After a year, I moved to working solely on the
	inventory management tools used on-site at our warehouse. As part of this team, I helped create
	the user experiences, microservices, and logic to speed up inventory throughput. I was also on the
	launch team for Optoro's current B2B soolution - BULQ.com.&nbsp;

<p>
	My current position is full-stack developer for RedShred, LLC, where I have developed several
	versions of the public API used to interact with our AIs that power the business. My first task
	was to develop and deploy a kubernetes cluster, which I did from scratch (using the raw YAML
	instead of management tools such as Helm). I have also developed a web application that uses the
	API I developed to interact with our data, in a PDF-viewer style.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	I have helped develop many applications in my years as a software developer and plan to help
	create many more. Maybe even yours!
