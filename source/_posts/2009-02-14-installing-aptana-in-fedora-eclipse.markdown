Aptana is a wonderful tool for web design. I have been using it for years for my personal web sites and my professional ones. I have been trying to get more people turned on to it, as well. When I installed Fedora 10 recently, I didn't want to install Aptana, as it has, in the past, FooBar'd my Eclipse installation. However, I am learning Ruby (on rails), and want to install RadRails, which means I need Aptana. I thought about installing Aptana standalone, but don't want to start up a new Eclipse platform just for my rails development. So -

First, I tried to install Aptana normally, as an eclipse plugin, several times. However, some parts of it refused to work and the "My Aptana" page never showed up. After assessing this problem, I thought there may be conflicts with some of the plugins Fedora installs through yum. IhadÂ  installed all the Eclipse plugins that my yum repositories offered.

So I removed all the plugins using yum. Since I needed those plugins, I had to get the update sites to install in Eclipse. Here are the update sites for the rpms, for convenience. You can get the same information by checking the Fedora Eclipse project wiki at http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Eclipse.
