# Rudeboy.dev

Hello, all! This is the blog for "Skaman Sam" Tyler, founder of Rude Boy
Enterprises. I love to code and fix problems. This blog is all about 
my code and solutions to problems relating to Linux, Windows (probably not much there), and other computer-related issues. I hope this will be as educational for you as for me!

## Source Branch
The `svelte` branch is the main git branch and is used for the development of this project. The deployed code is on the `gh-pages`` branch.

## Roll Your Own with Svelte

I rolled this site in about a day, using Svelte, MDSvex, and Tailwind. It has the following features:

* [X] 📚 Markdown-it compatibility (_mostly_)
  * [X] 📘 CommonMark (), 
  * [X] 📖 Extramark
  * [X] 😸 GitHub
  * [X] 📰 Pandoc
  * [ ] 💯 [working on 100% across ALL flavors](https://gist.github.com/vimtaai/99f8c89e7d3d02a362117284684baa0f)
* [X] 🌔 Dark-mode aware, and selectable
* [X] 🖌️ Themes! (selector is working, but themes aren't done yet)
* [X] ✅ Checkboxes! (user-editable, but not remembered)
* [X] ✔️ Tasklists (non-editable)
* [X] 📑 Table of Contents (custom placement inside markdown files)
* [X] ➗ Math/LaTeX support using KaTeX
* [X] 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 OpenGraph support (including images form articles)
* [X] 🆚 Good integration with VSCode / FrontMatter
* [X] 😹 deploy to github pages
