With the web becoming more pervasive and HTML5 threatening to annihilate Flash,
is JavaScript becoming a viable language for teaching advanced topics in
computer science? Here is a run-down of topics and projects that could be used
to teach the courses. The following course listing is taken from my university,
the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. I have organized them by course
content, as some courses use similar tools/methods. Also note that some courses
are designed to teach specific software, outside of the browser, so I have
placed them under the topic "Outside the Browser"

## General Programming Courses

## Graphics

## Algorithms

### 230 Elementary Data Structures and Algorithms
Advanced syntax of high level language taught in CSC 130. Emphasis on
modularization and abstraction. Big-O analysis of algorithms. Design and use of
abstract data types with various implementations.

## Networking

## Math-Based Courses

### 250 Foundations of Computer Science I
An introduction to the fundamental ideas underlying contemporary computer
science with a focus on the computation and construction of objects.

## Hardware
These classes are designed to teach specific hardware concepts

### 261 Computer Organization and Assembly Language
CPU, memory, I/O devices, digital logic design, psw. Number representations and
machine language. Assembly language instruction types, registers, addressing,
arithmetic, instruction format, opcodes, pseudo-opcodes, assembler directives,
system calls, and macros.

Many would think this class would be
difficult to do in the browser, but there are many assembly interpreters written
in JavaScript. Â Here are a few online interpreters of interest for this
classJS:
* [JSAssembly](http://http://timhatch.com/projects/jsassembly/) - an interpeter for x86 assembly codes
* [JSNES](http://benfirshman.com/projects/jsnes/) - Great working interpreter for SNES ROM images
* [6502asm](http://6502asm.com/) - 6502 assembly code interpreter

I did not find any online SPARC interpreters, as UNCG teaches this course in
SPARC assembly, but it would be trivial to modify one of the above to suit. As
for the Hardware design portion of this course, it is taught from a
textbook on SPARC assembly.

## Outside the Browser
These courses are designed to teach specific software, and
