    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>A Little Background</h2>

<p>The university from which I graduated did not teach any programming patterns, so when I entered the job market, I was not sure what <em>programming patterns</em> (a.k.a. &ldquo;<em>design patterns</em>&rdquo;) even were. My first job was definitely a learning experience, but since I was on a small team with other newbies, I didn&rsquo;t have many opportunities to grow well as a developer. So when I got my second job, with developers of all walks and experiences, I was thrown into many, many discussions about what pattern to apply to what idea. It was a little confusing at first, but very exhilarating! Here was the chance to lose some old, bad habits, and replace them with new <em>Patterns</em>! This post is about some patterns I really really like. I will add references and information about each pattern so you can learn as much about them them as you want!</p>

<h2>Migrations Are Only For Modifying The Database</h2>

<p>This is a difficult rule to follow for lots of Rails developers, experienced and not so. Since migrations are ususally automated, it is easy to get in the mindset of adding data changes to migrations. This violates the <strong>Single Responsibility Principle</strong>, which states, <em>a class should have a responsibility over a single feature of your application</em>.</p>

<div class='note'>
Scenario: You have a nice chat app and you want to add the ability for users to 'favorite' certain messages. At first, you have a boolean field in your database, so your original migration looks like this:

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">end</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
After a few months, and many _many_ messages (6 million!), you decide you want the 'favorite' button to handle a few more emotions, such as "makes me happy," "makes me sad," "makes me angry," "makes me crazy," and "meh, just a note." You then decide
</div>


<p>There are several ways of going about doing this. Once you analyze your requirements, you decide to use the existing <code>MessageFavorite#favorite</code> field to store the new information.Your immediate thought is to use a migration as such:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby">class UpdateMessageFavoritesToHandleMoreEmotions &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :message_favorites, :favorite_int, :int

    MessageFavorite.all.each do |mf|
      mf.update_attributes(favorite_int: MessageFavorite::EMOTIONS[mf.favorite ? 1 : 0])
    end

    remove_column :message_favorites, :favorite
    rename_column :message_favorites, :favorite_int, :favorite
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>There are a few problems with this approach, chiefly, running a data migration in the middle of a Rails migration like this is going to grind things to a halt. Your deploy is going to take forever! There is also an issue of what happens when there is an error in your data migration which will prevent everything from happening and could leave you with dangling data that another migration won&rsquo;t be able to fix.</p>

<p>There is also the issue of changes in environemnt. You may have this thoroughly tested while in development or in testing environments, but production is known to throw a wrench in the works. This means you need to baby-sit your data migrations, which you won&rsquo;t be able to do while it&rsquo;s in a deploy migration. You will need to run this separately, in a production console.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the obvious issue of violations to the <strong>SRP</strong>. This migration does three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>creates a new temporary column</li>
<li>creates the new data based on the existing data</li>
<li>replaces the original column with the new column</li>
</ol>


<p>The best way to address all these issues is to just break the migration up into its distinct pieces, by doing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>create and run a migration to create a new column in the Db</li>
<li>run the data migration (in the production console)</li>
<li>create and run a migration to replace the old column with the new one</li>
</ol>


<p>For many of us, step 2 is a very daunting task. Rails consoles in production are a hairy endeavor and could lead to bad data integrity and other sorts of bad things, including deleting all data! Fortunately for you guys, Rails already has a solution for this.</p>

<h3>Introducing Rails Runner</h3>

<p>Rails runner is a great tool for running data migrations and other one-shot data changes in your Rails application. You can execute rails runner as <code>rails runner bin/file.rb</code> or <code>rails r bin/file.rb</code>. While this won&rsquo;t solve data integrity issues, it will allow you to run a script in the current Rails context. This means you can have tested and peer reviewed data migrations! Amazing!</p>

<p>Rails runner runs the specified file in the context of your Rals app. This means you can get all the same benefits as running code from the console, but with the added bonus of</p>

<p>For ease of organization, you can put all your data migrations in <code>db/migrate/data/</code>. Another common place is <code>bin/one-shot/:year/:month/</code>. If this is a hotfix for a tech support ticket, it is helpful to put the ticket number in the name of the file, for instance <code>bin/one-shot/2016/09/TS-432098-update-bad-data.rb</code>. The point is, your team should agree on a place to put all these tickets so everyone can keep track of the changes. Developers can add a <code>post_checkout</code> git hook to automatically run all new scripts in the agreed-upon directory.</p>

<h3>Flow for Data Migrations</h3>

<div class="chart">
%% Waiting for the following chart to load...
graph TB;
  db?{database needs to be changed?}
  done[Done.]
  db["Run database migration (rails migration)"]
  data?{data needs to be changed?}
  data["run script to change data (one-shot)"]
  db_cleanup?{database needs cleanup?}
  db? -- yes --> db
  db? -- no  --> done
  db  --> data?
  data? -- no -->done
  data? -- yes --> data
  data --> db_cleanup?
  db_cleanup? -- yes --> db
  db_cleanup? -- no --> done
</div>


<p>If you want to run any migration in Rails, just follow these easy steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>For data migrations, create a one-shot and use <code>rails runner</code>. This is a best practice because it allows your team to test and review your changes. <strong>NEVER EVER NEVER RUN A PRODUCTION CONSOLE!</strong></li>
<li>Use <code>rails migrations</code> <strong>FOR DATABASE MODEL CHANGES ONLY</strong></li>
<li>Apply rules <em>1</em> and <em>2</em> as liberally as possible.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you want to create a data migration, use one-shots. If you want to create a data migration with a database change, separate the two concerns into a Rails migration, then a data migration, then a cleanup migration if needed. Of course, YMMV, as with any best practice, just make sure your team is onboard with it and, above all, rememeber that agreeing on standard practices is the core of a happy team!</p>

    <updated>2016-09-14T07:56:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://skamansam.github.io/blog/2016/09/14/fun-with-numbers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='notice'>
  This post is heavy with math formualae, so may take a few seconds to format correctly.
</div>




<div class='notice'>
  This post was originally written 2009/05/29, but was never finished. I just
  finished the revisions on 2016/09/14 and it is now complete.
</div>


<p>I have always had a certain love for math and the neat things you can do with it. Here is a bit of information and shortcuts I have picked up in a few of my math classes.</p>

<h2>Pascal&rsquo;s Triangle</h2>

<p>Pascal&rsquo;s Triangle is a pretty neat thing. It is very simple to construct and can be used to understand a lot of different ideas. It follows a very simple form: start with a &lsquo;1&rsquo; and add the two digits above  to get the next number. The first few line look like this:</p>

<div class='center'>
<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='text'><span class='line'>1
</span><span class='line'>1  1
</span><span class='line'>1  2  1
</span><span class='line'>1  3  3  1
</span><span class='line'>1  4  6  4  1
</span><span class='line'>1  5 10 10  5  1
</span><span class='line'>1  6 15 20 15  6  1
</span><span class='line'>...
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
</div>


<p>The line numbers start at 0, and continue on ad infinitum. In order to generate this triangle, programmatically, you would use something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="c++">vector&lt;int&gt; pascal(
      vector&lt;int&gt; prev, //the current (old) row data
      int *len,       //the length of the data
      int end,            //the row to retrieve
      int cur=0       //the current row we are on
      );

vector&lt;int&gt; pascal(vector&lt;int&gt; prev,int *len,int end,int cur){

       //return immediately if we are at the last row
      if (cur==end) return prev;

       //if the current vector length is 0, then set it to 1
          if (*len==0) *len=1;

          //create a temp vector (all 1's) to store the new row data
          vector&lt;int&gt; t((*len)+1,1);

          //sum the two rows
          for(int i=1;i&lt;(*len);i++)
            t[i]=prev[i-1]+prev[i];

          //increase the length by 1
          *len=(*len)+1;

          //return the new row data
          return pascal(t,len,end,cur+1);

}
</code></pre>

<h2>Binomial Expansion</h2></h2>

<p>Remember binomials from algebra? They were the pair of numbers used to create or simplify polynomial expressions, something like:</p>

<div class="tex">
$$ ( x + 3 )^3 = x^3 + 9x^2 + 27x + 27 $$
</div>


<p>You can use Pascal&rsquo;s triangle to find the coefficients of the polynomials. Let&rsquo;s begin by solving for the generic  case:</p>

<div class="tex">
$(a+b)^n = $
$(a+b)^{n-1}(a+b) = $
$(a+b)^{n-2}(a+b)^2 = $
$(a+b)^{n-2}((a+b)(a+b)) = $
$( (a*a) + (a*b) + (b*a) + (b*b) )(a+b)^{n-1} = $
$(a^2+2ab+b^2)(a+b)^{n-1} = $
</div>


<p>See the coefficients so far, with n=2 ? They are [1 2 1], which corresponds to the second row in Pascal&rsquo;s triangle. But this could be a fluke, right, so let&rsquo;s jump ahead to n=5 to see if that works as well.</p>

<div class="tex">
$(a+b)^n = $
$(a+b)^{n-6}(a+b)^5 = $
$(a+b)^{n-6}( (a+b) (a+b) (a+b) (a+b) (a+b) ) = $
$(a+b)^{n-6}( ( (a+b)(a+b) )( (a+b)(a+b) ) (a+b) ) = $
<br/>
[we know what $(a+b)^2$ is, so: ]
$(( a^2+2ab+b^2 )( a^2+2ab+b^2 )(a+b) )(a+b)^{n-6} = $
$( ( (a^2*a^2)+(a^2*2ab) + (a^2*b^2) + ( 2ab*a^2) + (2ab*2ab) + $
$(2ab*b^2) + (b^2*a^2)+(b^2*2ab) + (b^2*b^2) ) (a+b) )(a+b)^{n-6} = $
$( ( a^4 + 2a^3b+ a^2b^2 + 2a^3b + 4a^2b^2 + 2ab^3 + b^2a^2 + 2ab^3+ b^4) (a+b) )(a+b)^{n-6} = $
$( ( a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a2b^2 + 4ab^3+b^4) (a+b) )(a+b)^{n-6} = $
<br/>
[note: notice that the coefficients of $(a+b)^4$ are (1 4 6 4 1) ! ]
$( ( a^4*a + a^4*b + 4a^3b*a + 4a^3b*b + 6a^2b^2*a + $ <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$6a^2b^2*b + 4ab^3*a + 4ab^3*b + b^4*a+b^4*b))(a+b)^{n-6} =$
$( ( a^5 + a^4b + 4a^4b + 4a^3b^2 + 6a^3b^2 + 6a^2b^3 + 4a^2b^3 + 4ab^4 + ab^4+b^5))(a+b)^{n-6}=$
$( ( a^5 +5a^4b + 10a^3b^2 + 10a^2b^3 + 5ab^4 + b^5)(a+b)^{n-6}$
</div>


<p>There it is! The coefficients correspond to the rows on Pascal&rsquo;s Triangle!</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>Now, to make things a little simpler, I will note some interesting &ldquo;features&rdquo; about what we just did.</p>

<h4>General Formula for Binomial Expansion</h4>

<p>The general formula for binomial expansion is:</p>

<div class="tex">
$$(a+b)^n = \sum_{i=0}^{n}(P_{ni}a^{n-i}b^i)$$
</div>


<div class="tex">
Where $P_{ni}$ is the coefficient at row $n$ (starting from 0) and column $i$ in Pascal's Triangle. The formula means to add from $i=0$ to $n$ all the terms $(P_{ni}a^{n-i}b^i)$ , replacing $i$ with the number you are at. For example, supposing $i=3$, you would get:
</div>


<div class="tex">
$$\sum_{i=0}^{3}(P_{3i}a^{3-i}b^i) = $$
$$(P_{(3,0)}a^{3-0}b^0) + (P_{(3,1)}a^{3-1}b^1) + (P_{(3,2)}a^{3-2}b^2) + (P_{(3,3)}a^{3-3}b^3) = $$
since $P_3 = [1 3 3 1]$ , we finally get:
$$((1)a^{3-0}b^0) + ((3)a^{3-1}b^1) + ((3)a^{3-2}b^2) + ((1)a^{3-3}b^3) $$
cleaning up a bit :
$$a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$$
</div>


<h4>Exponents</h4>

<p>Note in all the expansions, the first variable counts down from n to 0, while the second variable counts up from 0 to n.</p>

<h3>Does your binomial already have coefficients?</h3>

<p>If your binomial already has coefficients, simply put them with their terms like so:</p>

<div class="tex">
$$\sum_{i=0}^{n}(P_{ni}(xa)^{n-i}(yb)^i)$$
Using the commutative property, it can be rewritten as such:
$$\sum_{i=0}^{n}(P_{3i}(x^{n-i}y^{i})a^{n-i}b^i) $$

Let's try an example!<br/>
$(3a+2b)^3 = $<br/>
$(1)(3a)^{3}(2b)^0 + (3)(3a)^{2}(2b) + (3)(3a)(2b)^2 + (1)(2b)^3 = $<br/>
$(1)(3^3)a^3 + (3)(3^2*2)a^{2}b + (3)(3*2^2)ab^2 + (1)(2^3)b^3 = $<br/>
$(1)(27)a^3 + (3)(18)a^{2}b + (3)(12)ab^2 + (1)(8)b^3 = $<br/>
$27a^3 + 54a^{2}b + 36ab^2 + 8b^3$
</div>


<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>As you can see, it is fairly easy to use Pascal&rsquo;s Triagel as a lookup table for
binomial exapnsion&rsquo;s coefficients. I hope you have much more fun in your maths!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have seen a lot of posts on cookie detection in Rails.

    <updated>2013-04-10T11:10:11-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://skamansam.github.io/blog/2013/04/10/building-a-unified-time-select-field</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before I migrated to Rails 3.2, I used a plugin to provide a unified input field for time_select with either the standard Rails ActionView or the SimpleForm gem (SimpleForm uses ActionView under the hood). I was happy until the Rails upgrade caused my gem to inexplicably stop working. I had a deadline to meet and could not be bothered with complicated solutions. I searched and searched for alternatives to this fine gem, but none were found. Then it hit me: why not just write my own code and replace the inputs with my own code? Surely it can&rsquo;t take too long to build a time input based on the simple_time_select gem! So here it is: my simple version of the gem, with only a few modifications from the simple_time_select gem.</p>

<p>Here is my old code, utilizing simple_time_select. The gem is used only if :simple_time_select is true, and it uses the :minute_interval, :time_separator, :start_hour, :end_hour, and a host of other options for setting the times. I wish it had a way for specifying just a start_time and end_time.</p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<div class="field">
  <%= f.input :start_time,
              :label=>"Start Time:",
              :default=>appt.start_time,
              :wrapper=>false,
              :simple_time_select => true,
              :label_html=>{:class=>"head"},
              :minute_interval => 5,
              :time_separator => "",
              :start_hour => 06,
              :end_hour => 17
   %>
</div>


<pre><code>
I had to search for an algorithm to use for the periodicity, and settled on the algorithm discussed in &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6783589/display-15-minute-steps-between-two-given-times"&gt;this discussion on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;, and is inlined as the :collection option. Since the :default option removes the inital blank I wanted as the first item in the list, I has to add a blank :include_blank option.
</code></pre>

<div class="field">
  <%- time_start = Time.now.change(:hour=>6,:minute=>0) %>
  <%- time_end = Time.now.change(:hour=>17,:minute=>55) %>
  <%- period = 5.minutes %>
  <%= f.input :start_time,
           :as=>:collection_select,
           :required=>true,
           :include_blank => '',
           :selected=>(
             f.object.start_time.blank? ?
               "" : f.object.start_time.strftime("%H:%M")
           ),
           :input_html=>{
             :name=>"appt[start_time(5i)]",
             :id=>"appt_start_time_5i"},
           :collection=> (
             [time_start].tap{
               |array| array << array.last + period
                 while array.last < time_end
             }).map{
               |t| [t.strftime("%l:%M %p"), t.strftime("%H:%M")]
             }
   %>
